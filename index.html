    Through my career I have developed software applications in the <strong>Financial, Defence, CRM and Medical industries</strong> using languages such as <strong>Java, C, C++, Delphi, Basic and Clipper</strong>.
    <br>
    I have spent the last 10 years working in the Financial sector with two local banks and a Canadian bank producing back-end systems on Java (JEE) enterprise servers.
    <br>
    My current role is as a Microservices Web Integration specialist developing <strong>REST</strong> <em>(JSON)</em> and <strong>SOAP</strong> <em>(XML)</em> web services on a WebLogic 12 application server with an Oracle back-end database.
    <br>
    At any point I am liaising with 3-4 Business units, understanding their business requirements and developing on as many projects. The areas of focus are project design, Java integration development, design and code reviews, and delivery.
    <br>
    The projects are managed using the Agile methodology and Scrums are held every morning.
    <br>
    In the delivery of most of these systems I led the design, development and deployment of the projects which was managed using Maven or Ant as the build tool and Hudson or Jenkins as the CI (Continuous Integration) server and the source repository
    was usually Subversion.
    <br>
    During the duration of the development, I mentored juniors and performed design and code reviews ensuring that effective use of industry best practices (mostly design patterns and vetted open source code) was made.
    <br>
    While working at these recent roles, I realised that due to my studies for my MBA I am able understand an organisation’s business fairly quickly and am able to contribute positively to the business’s profitability and projects’ success.
